# To populate tables with generated data:
# mvn compile
# mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="dbs.project.dev.Generator"

# Hereâ€™s how to launch our GUI:
# mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="dbs.project.main.gui.AppGui" 

# This will export the schema
# mvn process-classes

# This will run everything (compile, export schema, run AppGui)
mvn test
